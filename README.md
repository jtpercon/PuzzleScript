PuzzleScript
============

Open Source HTML5 Puzzle Game Engine

Try it out at http://www.puzzlescript.net

This is a little fork of PuzzleScript by James T. Perconti, which hacks a more
general feature for background music out of the existing youtube feature.
It allows you to add the following keyword to the preamble:

music http://www.mysong.com
    Loads another page hidden in the background so that music from that page
    will play during the game. This is just a quick hack of the youtube keyword
    to accept any full URL (instead of a youtube video ID). It's not very robust
    but it should at least allow you to run a Beepbox tune with your game.
